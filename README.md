# To Run
`yarn serve` will run both the server and the client

`yarn test` will run the existing reducer and util tests

# UX Improvements
- Adding "restore" functionality for deleted fields

# Things I'd improve
- Validating inputs on load (currently validates on change)
- Clicking "name" or other whitespace on row could check the row's checkbox field
- Using TypeScript on all files as opposed to a few
- Test coverage on the UI components
- Tons of things, otherwise
